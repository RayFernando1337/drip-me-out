- [x] Added modal state management
- [x] Implemented ESC key and click-outside-to-close
- [x] Display full-size images with metadata
- [x] TypeScript types properly defined

### Verification Status:

- ‚úÖ Images in gallery are clickable
- ‚úÖ Modal opens with full-size image
- ‚úÖ ESC key closes modal

---

## Phase 2: Core Sharing Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Completed Items:

- [x] Added `getImageById` query to `/convex/images.ts`
- [x] Created share route at `/app/share/[imageId]/page.tsx`
- [x] Created client component `/app/share/[imageId]/client.tsx`
- [x] Added "Copy Share Link" button to ImageModal
- [x] Implemented clipboard copy with toast notifications

### Implementation Details:

- **Schema Updates:** Added `sharingEnabled` and `shareExpiresAt` fields to images table
- **New Index:** Added `by_sharing_enabled` index for efficient queries
- **Share Settings Mutation:** Handles both enable/disable and expiration settings
- **UI Components:** Collapsible settings section with Switch toggle and Select dropdown
- **Expiration Options:** 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or never expire
- **Backward Compatibility:** Default sharing enabled for existing images

### Code Changes:

- **Modified:** `/convex/schema.ts` - Added sharing fields and index
- **Modified:** `/convex/images.ts` - Added `updateShareSettings` mutation, updated `getImageById`
- **Modified:** `/components/ImageModal.tsx` - Added full privacy settings UI with Switch and Select

### Verification Status:

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Schema migration completed
- ‚úÖ Settings UI renders correctly
- ‚úÖ Sharing toggle functionality works
- ‚úÖ Expiration selection updates properly

## Security Considerations üîí

### Current Security Status:

- **URL Structure:** Using Convex database IDs directly
- **ID Type:** Convex uses cryptographically random IDs (not sequential) ‚úÖ
- **Access Control:** Currently none (all images public) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Security Research Findings (August 31, 2025):

#### Convex ID Security Assessment:

‚úÖ **GOOD NEWS:** Convex IDs are already cryptographically random (similar to UUIDs)

- Not sequential or predictable
- Cannot enumerate through IDs
- No business intelligence leakage

#### Best Practices Analysis:

1. **Current Implementation is Acceptable** - Convex's random IDs provide similar security to UUID v4
2. **Primary Concern** - Lack of authorization checks (not the ID format itself)
3. **Defense in Depth** - ID obscurity should never be the only security layer

### Security Recommendations:

- [x] ‚úÖ Use non-sequential IDs (Convex provides this by default)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement proper authorization in `getImageById` query
- [ ] Consider adding share tokens for additional security layer
- [ ] Add rate limiting for share link generation
- [ ] Implement expiration dates (Phase 4)
- [ ] Add sharing toggle per image (Phase 4)

### Security Priority:

**HIGH PRIORITY:** Add authorization checks in Phase 4
**MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Rate limiting for share generation
**LOW PRIORITY:** Additional obfuscation (Convex IDs are already secure)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Security Research** - Investigate Convex ID security implications
2. **Phase 3 Implementation** - Add social sharing features
3. **Phase 4 Planning** - Plan schema migration strategy

### Decision Points:

1. Should we implement a separate share token system?
2. Do we need URL shortening/custom slugs?
3. Should we add analytics tracking?

---

## Development Notes

### Working Code Patterns:

- Using `useQuery` instead of `preloadQuery` for client components
- Proper TypeScript typing with `Id<"images">` from Convex
- Toast notifications with `sonner` library

### Lessons Learned:

1. Convex's `Preloaded` type not exported - use `useQuery` directly
2. TypeScript strict mode enforced - no `any` types allowed
3. Build process catches all type errors

---

## Testing Checklist

### Completed Testing:

- [x] TypeScript compilation (`bun run build`)
- [x] Basic share functionality
- [x] Modal interaction

### Pending Testing:

- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Open Graph preview testing
- [ ] Performance testing with large images
- [ ] Security penetration testing

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
bun run dev           # Start Next.js dev server
bunx convex dev      # Start Convex in development mode

# Testing
bun run build        # Check TypeScript compilation

# Component Installation (when needed)
bunx shadcn@latest add switch   # For Phase 4
```

## Questions for Product Team

1. **Security:** Is using Convex database IDs acceptable for public URLs?
2. **Analytics:** Should we track share link clicks?
3. **Watermarking:** Should shared images have watermarks?
4. **Expiration:** What should happen to expired links?
5. **Social Media:** Which platforms should we prioritize?

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk:

- Phase 1 & 2 implementations (internal features)

### Medium Risk:

- Using database IDs in public URLs (needs security review)
- No rate limiting on share generation

### High Risk:

- No current access control (Phase 4 will address)
- Schema migration for existing data (Phase 4)

The image sharing feature has been fully implemented with:

1. **Phase 1:** Click-to-view modal for individual images
2. **Phase 2:** URL-based sharing with copy-to-clipboard functionality
