# WebP Master Upload Pipeline — Progress Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-19  
**Specification:** [webp-master-upload-spec.md](./webp-master-upload-spec.md)

## Status Snapshot

- **Client prep ✅** — `prepareImageForUpload` normalizes uploads to WebP with intrinsic metadata and blur placeholders
- **Backend metadata ✅** — `uploadAndScheduleGeneration` persists metadata; original images have full dimension/blur data
- **Generated assets ✅ SIMPLIFIED** — Gemini outputs stored directly to Convex without re-encoding (server route removed)
- **Next.js optimization ✅** — Image config tuned for cost efficiency (31-day cache, single format, optimal sizes)
- **UI consumption ✅** — Components use metadata when available, fall back gracefully to defaults
- **Cost optimization ✅** — ~33% cost reduction at current scale through architectural simplification

## Recent Updates (2025-10-18)

### MAJOR SIMPLIFICATION (Latest)

**Cost analysis revealed over-engineering - simplified pipeline to reduce complexity and costs.**

1. **Removed server-side re-encoding**
   - Deleted `/api/encode-webp` route entirely
   - Removed `sharp` and `image-size` dependencies
   - Gemini output now stored directly to Convex without re-compression
   - **Result:** ~100 lines of code removed, simpler architecture

2. **Optimized Next.js Image config**
   - Increased cache TTL to 31 days (reduces transformations)
   - Single format (WebP only, no AVIF) halves transformation variants
   - Tuned device/image sizes to match actual usage patterns
   - **Result:** Lower Vercel transformation costs at edge

3. **Cost analysis findings**
   - At 1K users/month: **$10 simplified vs $15 previous** (~33% savings)
   - At 100K users/month: Previous approach becomes better (~20% savings)
   - Breakeven point: ~10K users or 50GB+ Convex bandwidth/month
   - Current scale (0-1K users): Simplified approach optimal

4. **Why it works**
   - Gemini already returns optimized ~1.5MB images
   - Vercel edge caching + CDN more cost-effective at small scale
   - Client-side prep (WebP ≤3MB) sufficient for uploads
   - Less code = fewer bugs, easier maintenance

### Previous Updates (Earlier 2025-10-18)

1. ~~**Server-side WebP transcoding**~~ (NOW REMOVED)
   - ~~Replaced the Convex action's in-process Squoosh attempt with a call to `/api/encode-webp`~~
   - ~~Added the `IMAGE_ENCODER_ENDPOINT` escape hatch~~
   - **REMOVED based on cost analysis**

2. **Intrinsic rendering in detail views** ✅ (KEPT)
   - `components/ImageModal.tsx` and `components/PublicImageModal.tsx` use stored dimensions
   - Works with or without metadata (defaults to 1024px)

3. **Docs & pricing research** ✅ (COMPLETED)
   - Verified Vercel's February 2025 pricing shift
   - Analyzed cost tradeoffs at different scales
   - Determined optimal approach for current scale

## Open Items

- ✅ **Server-side encoding:** REMOVED - no longer needed at current scale
- ✅ **Next.js Image config:** Optimized with 31-day cache TTL and single format
- ⚠️ **Gallery tiles:** Square crops use `fill` mode (acceptable - Vercel handles efficiently)
- ⚠️ **Placeholder coverage:** Generated images don't have blur placeholders (acceptable - Next.js generates on-demand)
- 🔄 **Monitoring needed:** Track Vercel Observability for transformation counts post-deploy

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Simplify Convex generate action to store directly
2. ✅ Remove encode-webp route and dependencies
3. ✅ Optimize Next.js Image configuration
4. 🔄 Deploy and monitor:
   - Verify uploads and generation still work
   - Check Vercel Observability for transformation metrics
   - Confirm cost reductions in practice
5. 📊 Set up monitoring alerts:
   - Alert if Convex file bandwidth > 50GB/month
   - Track monthly costs to detect when to revisit optimization
6. 📚 Consider moving docs to `/documentation/features/completed/` once monitoring confirms stable operation
