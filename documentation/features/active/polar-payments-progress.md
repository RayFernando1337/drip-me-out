# Polar Payments & Credits - Implementation Progress Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27  
**Specification:** [polar-payments-spec.md](./polar-payments-spec.md)

## Overview

Phase 1 (Sandbox) foundations are implemented and typechecked: schema (`users`, `payments`, `billingSettings`), checkout action, a single orders webhook with signature verification (Standard Webhooks HMAC), admin settings APIs, and a Buy Credits UI. Test checkout succeeds and credits are granted via webhook. We simplified to one webhook endpoint for one‑time purchases (`/polar/orders`) and do not use the Polar component (subscriptions) in this flow.

**Recent Update (2025-09-27):** Completed Phase 2 credit gating and Phase 3 UX implementation with full reactive credit system. All credit flows now work end-to-end with proper UI feedback and automatic updates.

## Phase Completion Summary

| Phase                       | Status | Completion | Notes                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1 — Foundations       | ✅     | 100%       | Sandbox checkout, webhook, admin settings in place; email/name prefill enabled |
| Phase 2 — Generation Gating | ✅     | 100%       | Credit gating implemented; atomic decrement; refund on failure system active   |
| Phase 3 — UX & Admin        | ✅     | 90%        | Reactive credit balance, unified purchase UX, zero-credit handling complete    |

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 2 — Generation Gating
- [x] **Credit Gating**: Implemented atomic credit checking and decrement in `images.uploadAndScheduleGeneration`
- [x] **Failure Refunds**: Added refund system in `users.refundCreditsForFailedGeneration` with billing settings integration
- [x] **Concurrency Safety**: Atomic operations prevent race conditions during credit consumption

### Phase 3 — UX & Reactive System  
- [x] **Reactive Credit Balance**: Implemented `CreditBalance` component with real-time updates via Convex queries
- [x] **Smart Free Trial Logic**: Enhanced `getCurrentUserCredits` to end free trial on first purchase OR 7-day expiry
- [x] **Unified Purchase UX**: Zero-credit state shows clickable balance instead of duplicate buttons
- [x] **Calm UI Design**: Removed distracting animations, added subtle hover states for better UX
- [x] **Purchase Feedback**: Enhanced success toasts with credit count updates and automatic UI refresh
- [x] **React Optimization**: Fixed memoization patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] **Admin Payments Dashboard**: Simple payments list and billing settings editor
- [ ] **Production Deployment**: Switch from sandbox to production Polar environment

## Spec Alignment (quick audit)

- [x] Data model (`users`, `payments`, `billingSettings`) — implemented
- [x] Checkout session creation (server action) — implemented  
- [x] Webhook fulfillment — implemented at `/polar/orders`; signature verified via Standard Webhooks; idempotent on `orderId`
- [x] User mapping — fulfilled by `externalCustomerId` → `getOrCreateUser(userId)` during order processing
- [x] **Credit gating before generation** — ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**
- [x] **Refund on final failure** — ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**  
- [x] **UX surfacing of balance** — ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**
- [ ] Admin payments dashboard — Phase 3 remaining

## Next Steps

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Implement payments list view and billing settings editor for administrators
2. **Production Deployment**: Configure production Polar environment and update webhook endpoints  
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add analytics for credit usage patterns and purchase conversion
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing of credit flows in production environment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Reactive Credit System Architecture
- **Backend**: Convex mutations use `ctx.db.patch()` for atomic credit operations
- **Frontend**: `useQuery(api.users.getCurrentUserCredits)` provides automatic UI updates
- **State Management**: React `useMemo()` patterns prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with proper toast notifications and modal triggers

### Key Files Modified
- `convex/users.ts`: Enhanced free trial logic and refund system
- `convex/images.ts`: Atomic credit decrement before image generation  
- `components/CreditBalance.tsx`: Reactive balance display with unified UX
- `components/CreditPurchaseModal.tsx`: Improved purchase flow with better feedback
- `app/page.tsx`: Conditional UI rendering based on credit state

## Blockers/Issues

- **Resolved**: All major UX and reactivity issues addressed
- **Next**: Admin dashboard implementation is the only remaining Phase 3 item
