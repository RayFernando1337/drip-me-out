# AnimeLeak Rebrand Implementation Plan

## Overview

Rebrand from "Anime Studio" to "Anime Leak" with updated messaging emphasizing "anime leaking into reality". Remove Studio Ghibli references from customer-facing areas, update social handles, and configure environment variable for site URL.

## 1. Package Configuration

### package.json (line 2)

```json
"name": "animeleak"
```

### convex/payments/createCheckoutSession.ts (line 60)

```typescript
metadata: { userId: session.userId, app: "animeleak" }
```

## 2. Frontend Display Names

### app/page.tsx

- Line 27: `<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white">Anime Leak</h1>`
- Line 407: `<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">Anime Leak</h1>`

## 3. Metadata and SEO

### app/layout.tsx (line 20-21)

```typescript
title: "Anime Leak - Where Anime Leaks Into Reality",
description: "AI-powered anime transformation. Watch everyday objects leak into anime reality with whimsical illustrations and magical effects.",
```

### app/share/[imageId]/page.tsx

- Line 17: `title: "Image Not Found - Anime Leak"`
- Line 23: `title: "Check Out My Anime Transformation!"`
- Line 24: `description: "Watch objects transform as anime leaks into reality. Create yours!"`
- Line 27: `description: "Watch objects transform as anime leaks into reality. Create yours!"`
- Line 34: `description: "Watch objects transform as anime leaks into reality."`

## 4. Taglines and Messaging

### components/HeroGalleryDemo.tsx

- Line 99-100: Replace "Watch everyday items come alive with Studio Ghibli-inspired magic. Our AI transforms ordinary objects into whimsical anime illustrations." with "Where anime leaks into reality. Watch everyday objects transform into whimsical anime illustrations with bold outlines, vibrant colors, and magical effects."
- Line 127: Replace "Studio Ghibli Style" with "Anime Reality"

### app/page.tsx (lines 29, 409)

```typescript
Transform objects into anime illustrations
```

Keep as is - this is clear and direct.

## 5. Social Handles

### components/ImageModal.tsx (line 153)

```typescript
const text = "Check out my anime transformation! Created with @RayFernando1337 ðŸŽ¨âœ¨";
```

## 6. Component Text Updates

### components/PublicImageModal.tsx (line 94-95)

```typescript
Get inspired by real creations from the Anime Leak community. Sign in to transform your own photos into magical anime illustrations where anime leaks into reality.
```

## 7. Environment Variable Setup

Create `.env.local` (or update existing):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://animeleak.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<existing_value>
```

Update sharing functions to use environment variable:

### components/ImageModal.tsx

- Line 139: `const shareUrl = \`\${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || window.location.origin}/share/\${currentImage._id}\`;`
- Line 152: `const shareUrl = \`\${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || window.location.origin}/share/\${currentImage._id}\`;`

## 8. Documentation Updates

### README.md

- Line 1: `# ðŸŽ¨ Anime Leak`
- Line 3: `An AI-powered image transformation app that transforms everyday objects into magical anime illustrations where anime leaks into reality.`
- Line 17: `- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Transformation**: Uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to transform objects with anime leaking into reality`
- Line 90: `cd animeleak`
- Line 139: `animeleak/`

### CLAUDE.md (line 9)

```

### documentation/features/active/unauthenticated-gallery-spec.md (line 378)

```typescript
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">Anime Leak</h1>
```

## 9. Remove Studio Ghibli References (Customer-Facing Only)

Keep the AI prompt in `convex/generate.ts` as-is since it's internal and guides the AI model effectively.

### app/layout.tsx (line 21)

Already updated in step 3.

Update all references:
